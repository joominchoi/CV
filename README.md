## About me

I am a junior software developer with expertise in product-led growth and experimentation. I was most recently a member of the cross-functional growth squad at ClearScore where I built experimental features that drove user and revenue growth.

I am currently looking to transition into front-end role that will enable me to continue my learning and growth.

## Skills

**Communication**: Effective communication and conflict resolution was the single most important skill that was required of my job as a bar owner and one that I have developed the most over the years. Listening well to my staff and customers for any ideas or problems they may have, as well as conveying information competently on both a technical and emotional level was my key to success in retaining staff and customers, but most importantly, keeping everyone happy. This skill was heavily used at Makers during the daily pair-programming sessions at the beginning of the course and proved crucial towards the end whilst collaborating in teams for our group projects.

**Problem solving & Adaptability**: Unique problems arose daily whilst running SingSing. Problems could range from draught beer suddenly losing carbonation to the building experiencing a power cut. Each unique problem required a unique solution. My ability to think outside of the norm, adapt to the situation and remain undeterred until a solution is found has been an essential skill to possess on my software development journey so far.    

**Planning & Organisation**: I was responsible for sorting out staff rotas, table reservations, and events, amongst other tasks. All of these tasks required proper time management and looking ahead of time for big events to undertake adequate preparation and looking for any potential clashes. This skill was put to the test the most during our group projects at Makers as it was everyone's first time and it was difficult to set out a course of action. However, the organisation of daily standups, allocation of tickets and time estimations for individual features, among other planning tools were critical to accomplishing our goals.
