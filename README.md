## About me

Managing a business for six years allowed me to see first-hand the power and importance of technology.  From switching to an EPOS to creating a website as well as running promotions on the various social media platforms, I experienced how efficient and valuable these tools are, both for companies and customers alike.

Realising that technology is an indispensable aspect of the world we live in today, my interest for technology grew ever more, which naturally led me to teaching myself to code before eventually joining Makers.

I am a highly motivated and determined individual, with an appetite for learning. I have a proven track-record for delivering results and enjoy the challenges that come with every unique problem. The core programming fundamentals I have acquired through Makers combined with the soft skills I have honed over the years as a businessman, has made me into a competent developer.

I am currently looking for a role that will enable me to continue my learning and growth.

## Skills

**Communication**: Effective communication and conflict resolution was the single most important skill that was required of my job as a bar owner and one that I have developed the most over the years. Listening well to my staff and customers for any ideas or problems they may have, as well as conveying information competently on both a technical and emotional level was my key to success in retaining staff and customers, but most importantly, keeping everyone happy. This skill was heavily used at Makers during the daily pair-programming sessions at the beginning of the course and proved crucial towards the end whilst collaborating in teams for our group projects.

**Problem solving & Adaptability**: Unique problems arose daily whilst running SingSing. Problems could range from draught beer suddenly losing carbonation to the building experiencing a power cut. Each unique problem required a unique solution. My ability to think outside of the norm, adapt to the situation and remain undeterred until a solution is found has been an essential skill to possess on my software development journey so far.    

**Planning & Organisation**: I was responsible for sorting out staff rotas, table reservations, and events, amongst other tasks. All of these tasks required proper time management and looking ahead of time for big events to undertake adequate preparation and looking for any potential clashes. This skill was put to the test the most during our group projects at Makers as it was everyone's first time and it was difficult to set out a course of action. However, the organisation of daily standups, allocation of tickets and time estimations for individual features, among other planning tools were critical to accomplishing our goals.
